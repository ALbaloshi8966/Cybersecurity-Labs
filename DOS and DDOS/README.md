This project demonstrates Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in a controlled lab environment using tools like hping3, Wireshark, Nmap, and Metasploitable 2. 
It covers how attackers flood a target system with traffic, how the impact can be analyzed using packet capture, and what defense strategies (firewalls, IDS/IPS, rate limiting, and cloud protections) can be applied.
The lab provides hands-on experience in both the attack techniques and the mitigation methods, making it a practical learning resource for cybersecurity.

⚠️ Disclaimer:
This project is created strictly for educational purposes in a controlled lab environment. 
Performing scans or attacks on unauthorized systems is illegal and unethical.
