# Metasploitable2 - Full System Compromise

## 📌 Lab Description
In this lab, I performed a complete penetration test against the intentionally vulnerable **Metasploitable2** machine. The goal was to simulate a real-world attack scenario, gain initial access, and escalate privileges to achieve a **full system compromise**.

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used
- **Nmap** → Service & port scanning
- **Hydra** → Brute-force attacks on services
- **Metasploit Framework** → Exploiting known vulnerabilities
- **Linux Commands** → Post-exploitation and privilege escalation

## 🔑 Key Findings
- Discovered multiple open and vulnerable services (FTP, SSH, Web apps)
- Exploited vsftpd backdoor and gained shell access
- Performed privilege escalation to gain **root access**
- Achieved **complete system compromise**

## 📸 Screenshots
(Screenshots of Nmap results, exploitation, and root shell access)

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Improved skills in vulnerability scanning and exploitation  
- Learned practical post-exploitation techniques  
- Understood the risks of misconfigurations in legacy systems
